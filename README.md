# Meditation-Tracker (Built using MERN Stack)
![Meditation](/meditation.png)
## Project Overview
* This project was my first introduction to completing a full stack application from the ground up, using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js (MERN).
* The aim for the project was to create an application which I could use in my day to day life. One activity I try to practice regularly is mindfulness and thus I thought I could create a meditation tracker to track each time I meditated. The app would take input as to why I was meditating, the date I meditated, the duration and whether I felt better after the session.
* The project was extremely rewarding for I spent a large amount of time learning the different stacks and how each one was connected and interacted with the others. There was lots of trial and error, breaks and fixes and resulted in a product which I am happy to show for my first full stack application. 

## Future Considerations
* I look to implement a calender tracker which would take the inputted date and create a green square on the calender corresponding to that date. This would provide a visual representation of each day that I meditated
* Implement the database with postgreSQL which can incorporate SQL language which is a preference to MongoDB
* Go further with routing and gain a deeper understanding of how the front end and back end interact to improve my knowledge on that aspect of the stack.
* Host and deploy the website using AWS
